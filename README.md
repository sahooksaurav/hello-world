# hello-world
My first Github repo

Hello people of this planet
My name is Saurav. And I am currently pursuing my Bachelors in Civil Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Rourkela which is a premier technical institute of the nation. It is also considered as an institute of national importance under Ministry of Education. Government of India.
I have recently developed an ardent fascination into the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. Initial get through of the basics of these made me more inquisitive to explore and work on live projects. Eventually, this made me realise the importance and usage of Git which made me open a new account and henceforth a new repository in the same. Looking forward to a great Git experience with innumerous projects on the way. Cheers and Happy learning!
